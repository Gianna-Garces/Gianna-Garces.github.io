Think of it as a simplified version of Craigslist specifically tailored to cater to the needs of plant lovers. This collaborative project involved the combined efforts of myself and three other partners, resulting in the creation of a highly functional and user-friendly platform. Together, we successfully developed a seamless system for posting and browsing advertisements. Through our collaborative work, we gained valuable experience in web development, database management, and software testing.

Our primary objective revolved around optimizing the user experience and interface. Employing dynamic elements sourced from an object array, we creatively showcased a diverse array of coffee names and roast types. Additionally, we implemented a local storage feature that empowered users to conveniently save and retrieve their search results. To further elevate the user experience, we introduced a functionality enabling users to generate new coffee types and roasts. Moreover, we integrated filtering options based on roast type, which users could access either through manual input or selection.

Furthermore, our solution offered the convenience of selecting individual checkboxes for bulk deletion and the ability to modify movie details such as title and year.

    <h3>Weather Map</h3>
    <p>
      Presenting a weather application that I single-handedly developed, providing accurate forecasts for global locations. With a sleek and user-friendly interface, the application ensures seamless access to essential information. By harnessing up-to-date weather data, it delivers daily forecasts encompassing various metrics like temperature, precipitation, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and humidity. This project allowed me to demonstrate proficiency in HTML, CSS, jQuery, AJAX, and the integration of the OpenWeatherMap API.
