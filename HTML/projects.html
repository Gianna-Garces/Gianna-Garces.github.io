    <h3>Plantlister</h3>
    <p>
      Introducing Plantlister, a comprehensive full-stack website designed exclusively for plant enthusiasts, offering a dynamic platform for buying and selling a diverse range of seeds, seedlings, plants, trees, and more. Think of it as a simplified version of Craigslist specifically tailored to cater to the needs of plant lovers. This collaborative project involved the combined efforts of myself and three other partners, resulting in the creation of a highly functional and user-friendly platform. Together, we successfully developed a seamless system for posting and browsing advertisements. Through our collaborative work, we gained valuable experience in web development, database management, and software testing. Our collective expertise in paired programming, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Spring, MySQL, and jQuery played a crucial role in bringing this plant-focused marketplace to life.

    <h3>Coffee Project</h3>
    <p>
      In close collaboration with a partner, I engaged in the design and development of an engaging web-based coffee website. Our primary objective revolved around optimizing the user experience and interface. Employing dynamic elements sourced from an object array, we creatively showcased a diverse array of coffee names and roast types. Additionally, we implemented a local storage feature that empowered users to conveniently save and retrieve their search results. To further elevate the user experience, we introduced a functionality enabling users to generate new coffee types and roasts. Moreover, we integrated filtering options based on roast type, which users could access either through manual input or selection. This project fortified my skills in paired programming, as well as proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

    <h3>Weather Map</h3>
    <p>
      Presenting a weather application that I single-handedly developed, providing accurate forecasts for global locations. With a sleek and user-friendly interface, the application ensures seamless access to essential information. By harnessing up-to-date weather data, it delivers daily forecasts encompassing various metrics like temperature, precipitation, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and humidity. This project allowed me to demonstrate proficiency in HTML, CSS, jQuery, AJAX, and the integration of the OpenWeatherMap API.

    <h3>Silver Screen Dreams</h3>
    <p>
      As part of a paired programming project with a collaborative partner, we successfully designed and developed a web-based movie database. Our implementation revolved around the effective utilization of CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality to manage dynamically rendered elements. To enhance user interaction, we incorporated modal windows, enabling seamless deletion, addition, and editing of movies. Furthermore, our solution offered the convenience of selecting individual checkboxes for bulk deletion and the ability to modify movie details such as title and year. This project sharpened our skills in paired programming, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery.
